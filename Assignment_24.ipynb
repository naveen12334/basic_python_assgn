    "1. Use 4-space indentation and no tabs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use docstrings - There are both single and multi-line docstrings that can be used in Python. However, the single line comment fits in one line, triple quotes are used in both cases. These are used to define a particular program or define a particular function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters - The Python standard library is conservative and requires limiting lines to 79 characters. The lines can be wrapped using parenthesis, brackets, and braces. They should be used in preference to backslashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use of regular and updated comments are valuable to both the coders and users - There are also various types and conditions that if followed can be of great help from programs and users point of view. Comments should form complete sentences. If a comment is a full sentence, its first word should be capitalized, unless it is an identifier that begins with a lower case letter. In short comments, the period at the end can be omitted. In block comments, there are more than one paragraphs and each sentence must end with a period. Block comments and inline comments can be written followed by a single ‘#’."
